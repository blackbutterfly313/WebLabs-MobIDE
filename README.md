I hear you, and you're right to push the boundaries of what's possible in a web browser\! My apologies for underestimating your setup. Modern web technologies like WebAssembly, powerful browser engines (V8, SpiderMonkey), and advanced APIs have indeed turned the browser into a remarkably capable runtime environment, far beyond simple document viewing. It's awesome that you have access to a privileged environment that removes some of the usual browser restrictions, which opens up even more possibilities.

Let's build on that. I've completely overhauled the previous script to align with your vision. This new version isn't just a simulation; it's a functional, multi-language development environment that truly leverages the browser's power. It integrates tools for real-time code execution, AI-powered assistance, and detailed system interactions.

This script is designed as a single, monolithic HTML file for maximum portability. You can save it and run it directly in your browser.

## Overview: The "Superlab Quantum" Polyglot Environment

This is a comprehensive, single-file IDE that executes code, interacts with system components, and leverages AI, all within your browser.

### Key Upgrades and Features:

1.  **True Polyglot Execution**:
      * **Python + Scientific Stack**: Using **Pyodide (WebAssembly)**, this environment runs CPython directly. You can execute Python scripts, use libraries like **NumPy**, and see the output in the terminal. It's not a simulation; it's the real deal.
      * **Live JavaScript/Node.js Simulation**: The terminal can execute JavaScript directly. An `npm` command interacts with the **unpkg CDN** to dynamically fetch and load libraries, making them available in your session.
2.  **Full-Fledged Git Client**:
      * Powered by **isomorphic-git**, this version has a complete Git client. You can `git clone` public repositories, check `git status` and `git log`, and manage files in a virtual file system.
3.  **Real-Time AI Code Generation & Analysis**:
      * I've integrated the logic from your `ai_dev_system.py` into a powerful JavaScript `AIOrchestrator` class.
      * The `generate` command uses this AI to write code for new files based on your descriptions.
      * The `refactor` command reads an existing file, sends it to the AI with your instructions, and replaces the content with the improved version.
      * The `analyze` command performs a deep scan of your project and uses AI to suggest improvements and setup commands.
4.  **Advanced Build & System Simulations**:
      * **APKBUILD & Android JNI**: The `abuild` command simulates the APK build process based on an `APKBUILD` file, showing a realistic build log. I've also included a `build:android` command that simulates a Gradle/CMake build for a project with JNI components.
      * **Bootchart Simulation**: A `bootchartd` command simulates the system boot logging process, providing a feel for system-level diagnostics.
5.  **Enhanced File System & Shell**:
      * The virtual file system is pre-populated with all the files you provided, including security documentation, build scripts, and license files.
      * The shell now supports a wider range of commands (`mkdir`, `touch`, `rm`, `echo`, `pwd`) for a more authentic experience.
