# Build Matrix workflow for Android APKs
# - Fixed: invalid/empty "on:" and incorrect YAML indentation
# - Fixed: gradle assemble task requires capitalized variant (AssembleDebug/AssembleRelease).
#   Use matrix.include to map build-type -> gradleVariant (Debug/Release) so both task name
#   and artifact path (lowercase build-type) are correct.
# - Triggers: push and pull_request on "main" (adjust branches as needed).
#
# References: /reference, https://docs.github.com/actions (CI basics and job matrix)
