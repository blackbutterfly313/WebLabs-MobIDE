Model Thought 
We are going to create a GitHub workflow that integrates the GLM model (from Zhipu AI) into the GitHub repository. The workflow will use the GLM model (specifically, we can use the GLM-4 or GLM-4.5 model) via API to assist in various development tasks. We'll set up the workflow to trigger on push, pull_request, and issue events.
Steps:
• We'll use the Zhipu AI API (bigmodel.cn) to interact with the GLM model.
• We need to set up the API key as a secret in the repository (named ZHIPU_API_KEY).
• The workflow will include steps to: a. Checkout the repository. b. Set up the environment (if needed). c. Call the GLM model API for various tasks (like code review, generating documentation, answering questions, etc.).
• We'll create a job that runs on ubuntu-latest.
We'll design the workflow to be "crazy good" by having multiple steps that use the GLM model in creative ways.
Example tasks:
• On push: Analyze the code changes and provide a summary or suggestions.
• On pull request: Review the code and post comments.
• On issues: Suggest solutions or provide insights.
We'll use the actions/github-script to interact with GitHub and post comments.
Note: We are using the GLM model via API. We can use the zhipuai Python package or make direct HTTP requests.
Since we are in a GitHub Actions environment, we can use a Python script to call the API.
Let's create a workflow file named glm-companion.yml (or similar) in the .github/workflows directory.
We'll break down the workflow into steps:
• Checkout the repository.
• Set up Python (if we choose to use the zhipuai package).
• Install the zhipuai package.
• Define a script that uses the GLM model for different tasks based on the event.
However, note that the user wants a "crazy goof" workflow, so we can make it fun and interactive.
We'll create a step that:
• For a push event: Summarizes the changes in a fun way.
• For a pull request: Reviews the code and posts a comment with suggestions and maybe a joke.
• For an issue: Tries to understand the issue and provides a helpful response.
We'll use the following structure:
name: GLM Companion
on: push: branches: [ main, develop ] pull_request: types: [opened, synchronize] issues: types: [opened]
jobs: glm-assist: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - name: Checkout uses: actions/checkout@v4
- name: Set up Python uses: actions/setup-python@v4 with: python-version: '3.10' - name: Install dependencies run: | python -m pip install --upgrade pip pip install zhipuai - name: Run GLM Companion env: ZHIPU_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.ZHIPU_API_KEY }} run: | python .github/scripts/glm_companion.py 
Then we create a Python script (.github/scripts/glm_companion.py) that: - Detects the event type (push, pull_request, issue). - Based on the event, it will: * Push: Get the commit messages and changed files, then ask GLM to summarize in a fun way. * Pull Request: Get the diff and ask GLM to review the code and provide feedback. * Issue: Get the issue title and body, then ask GLM to provide a helpful response.
We'll also use the actions/github-script to post comments or create issues if needed.
However, note that we cannot post comments from the Python script directly without a GitHub token. We can use the GITHUB_TOKEN provided by GitHub Actions.
Alternatively, we can use the actions/github-script to call the GLM API and then post the response.
Let's adjust: We'll use the actions/github-script to handle the GitHub interactions and call the GLM API via a JavaScript action.
But note: The GLM API is a REST API, so we can call it from any language. We can use actions/github-script to call the GLM API and then post the response.
We'll do:
• For pull requests and issues, we'll use actions/github-script to:
• Get the necessary data (diff, issue content).
• Call the GLM API (using fetch or axios).
• Post the response as a comment.
• For push events, we might just log the summary or create an issue with the summary.
However, the user wants a "crazy goof" workflow, so let's make it fun and interactive.
We'll create a workflow that:
On push: - Summarizes the changes and posts a comment on the commit (if possible) or creates an issue with the summary.
On pull request: - Reviews the code and posts a comment with: * A summary of changes * Potential issues * Suggestions * A fun fact or joke related to the code
On issue: - Tries to understand the issue and provides a helpful response, maybe with some code snippets or links.
We'll use the GLM-4 model (or the latest available) for these tasks.
Let's write the workflow using actions/github-script for the events that require posting.
We'll break the job into steps for each event type.
However, note that we cannot have conditional steps in the same job for different events? Actually, we can use if conditions.
We'll structure the job with steps that run conditionally based on the event.
Example:
steps: - name: Checkout uses: actions/checkout@v4
- name: Handle Push Event if: github.event_name == 'push' uses: actions/github-script@v6 with: script: | // ... code to handle push - name: Handle Pull Request Event if: github.event_name == 'pull_request' uses: actions/github-script@v6 with: script: | // ... code to handle pull request - name: Handle Issue Event if: github.event_name == 'issues' uses: actions/github-script@v6 with: script: | // ... code to handle issue 
But note: We need to call the GLM API from within the script. We'll use the @actions/github and @actions/http-client or just fetch.
We'll use the fetch API available in the GitHub Actions environment.
Let's write the workflow accordingly.
We'll create a workflow file named glm-companion.yml:
name: GLM Companion on: push: branches: [ main, develop ] pull_request: types: [opened, synchronize] issues: types: [opened] jobs: glm-assist: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - name: Checkout uses: actions/checkout@v4 with: fetch-depth: 0 # To get the full history for diff - name: Handle Push Event if: github.event_name == 'push' uses: actions/github-script@v6 env: ZHIPU_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.ZHIPU_API_KEY }} with: script: | const { execSync } = require('child_process'); const core = require('@actions/core'); // Get the commit messages and changed files const commitHash = context.sha; const previousCommit = context.payload.before; // Get changed files const changedFiles = execSync(`git diff --name-only ${previousCommit} ${commitHash}`).toString().trim().split('\n'); // Get commit messages const commitMessages = execSync(`git log --format=%s ${previousCommit}..${commitHash}`).toString().trim().split('\n'); // Prepare the prompt for GLM const prompt = ` You are a fun and enthusiastic coding companion.

yaml 
Note:
• We are using the GLM-4 model. You can change it to "glm-4-air" or other available models if needed.
• The API endpoint is for the BigModel platform (Zhipu AI).
• We are using the fetch API to make HTTP requests.
• We are creating issues for push events and comments for pull requests and issues.
This workflow is "crazy good" because it integrates the GLM model in a fun and helpful way, providing summaries, reviews, and responses.
Remember to set the ZHIPU_API_KEY secret in the repository settings.
